Sprint Review
Team 8
At the end of the sprint, the team will conduct a sprint review. Show evidence that the team completed a thorough sprint review. As part of that evidence, each team needs to invite another team for the review. In your README, answer the following questions:

a. What did you learn from doing our first sprint?
We set out to do a lot more than we needed to in the first sprint. We included way more tasks than what was necessary for our first sprint, like setting up a database, and we realized too late that they were out of scope for sprint 1.

b. What went well? Why?
We would say overall, our client meetings went well. Although we had to meet again to clarify some details, we were able to come to an understanding and get the information we needed.

c. What didn’t go well? Why not?
Our organization for sprint 1 was not the greatest. We were unclear about assigning tasks at that start and ended up not doing so till the end of the sprint. There was a lot of confusion as to what was being done in meetings and we struggled to figure out what we were doing. Our poor coordination led us to fall behind on our schedule. Although we did include too much in the scope of our first sprint, we may have been able to accomplish more if we had been more organized. We also overestimated what we could accomplish in our first sprint. We couldn't complete everything that we had planned to.

d. How can you make things better next time?
First things first we need to delegate work immediately. Our working structure was too loose for this sprint and we were confused as to what to do or where to start. We also need to start sooner so we can have more time at the end to ensure we have met all our goals and have time to fix any mistakes. Another thing that could help us improve would be to communicate when tasks are completed so we know what we can move onto.

e. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
We are somewhat satisfied with the current progress but will be alot happier once more of the pieces in the project come together. We are also disappointed in how much we could finish in this sprint. We want to readjust our future sprints to better estimate what we can accomplish.

f.Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?
